      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <h4>How do the principles of Neuroplasticity benefit people?</h4>
      <p>The benefits of understanding neuroplasticity is important to one's learning and education. Recognising that the brain has the ability to amend and change its structure and function encourages people to continue learning at any age. The principles are simple and using them throughout learning help you to achieve the best you can for yourself. </p>
      <h4>How I might engage with these principles</h4>
      <p>Creating good learning habits for both my learning and lifestyle will be beneficial for this course. For coding I know repetition is key to cementing terms and methods in your brain. By being able to cement learnings in your brain (ie learnings that can be memorised) I can focus on expanding my knowledge and dive deeper in my education. The principle of repetition also relates to two others (Use it or lose it, and use it and improve it), being reminded of this will be beneficial for my long term goals. By understanding that your brain can actually “delete” information if it hasn’t been used for some time is a great reminder that even if I have learned something I need to continue to practice and revise.</p>
      <h4>How can you increase your Neuroplasticity?</h4>
      <p>Mindfulness, regular exercise, good sleep and enriching your environment are all ways to increase your neuroplasticity. These factors help your brain to adapt, change and overall improve brain function.</p>
      <p><em>Who doesn't like a good podcast? I found this short one very helpful for understanding some of the science behind Neuroplasticity</em></p>

      <h3>The Growth Mindset</h3>
      <h4>What is it and why is it relevant?</h4>
      <p>The growth mindset showcases a more positive outlook on learning. To me, it’s commitment to yourself to continue to learn and improve when a goal is out of reach or to overcome failure. This involves believing in yourself even when times are tough and to thrive when challenges arise. A fixed mindset is the opposite and often portrays a negative outlook on improvement and mistakes. Without having a growth mindset for this course there is less chance of achieving goals and getting the best out of the learning materials provided. Although its relevance is important to all learning subjects I think it’s particularly important to Web Development as there are many obstacles and challenges that you will face. A simple mindset shift of “I can’t” to “I can” or “I will” is a great start to switching your mindset to growth. </p>
      <h4>What changed for me whilst learning about The Growth Mindset</h4>
      <p>The term "not yet" really stood out to me, this term is being used to fail students instead of the standard "not achieved/failed". A small change in wording can change a students mindset and help them to believe that there is more opportunity and growth to come from failings. This simple term is a great reminder that you shouldn’t doubt yourself and say things like “I can’t”. Learning can be frustrating and draining, when faced with challenges remind youself that persistance and patience can help you to overcome great things. Maybe you're not quite there "yet" but you will be soon. </p>
      <h4>How will I integrate the growth mindset into my learning?</h4>
      <p>Use of effort, acceptance, inspiration, feedback, reflection throughout my learnings.</p>
