    <h4>What are my values and where do they come from?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Loyalty</li>
      <li>Determination</li>
      <li>Curiosity</li>
      <li>Teamwork</li>
      <li>Appreciation</li>
      <li>Courage</li>
      <li>Kindness</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I believe the majority of my values have come from my family, past and present. My two late grandfather's Cyril and Ralph are two people that came to mind when I was identifying my values. <br><br> Cyril was an entrepreneur from a young age, his courage and curiosity was something I always admired. He also had great appreciation for life and enjoyed every single thing life had to offer. Ralph was a man of many trades; he played various sports and was loyal, determined and always put others first. He too moved to Canada at a young age (by boat!) and worked as a truck driver. I have and will always continue to follow their footsteps as I navigate my way through the world.<br><br>
    There are many achievements in my life that I am proud of. One that sticks out to me the most was moving to the other side of the world at age 20. I was always a person of comfort and a shy child growing up and I wanted to change this for the better. I threw myself in the deep end and started organising my travels with my parents.There were some delays in obtaining a Visa and my trip was pushed backwards but I was determined to keep my small dream alive. After waiting almost 6 months I finally got myself a visa, booked a flight and left within 3 days of receiving the visa. My first destination was Vancouver, a huge city considering I had never been further than Australia. I remember arriving without any friends or family and thinking to myself I needed to build myself a lifestyle from scratch, a scary thought! I moved to a small town called Jasper which is located in the middle of the Rocky Mountains and made a lot of friends who I’m still in touch with today. During this time I overcame many challenges that I wouldn’t have been put through if I hadn’t done it myself and it was the best time of my life. Curiosity and appreciation were two values that really excelled during my travels. I believe being outside of my comfort zone helped to shape my identity to who I am today.<br><br>
    <h4>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
    <p>Whilst in Dubai playing Indoor Cricket I got some terrible news that my Grandad had passed away. I found out the night before our first final and I’d already been selected to play in the team. Emotions were high and I wasn’t with my family which was tough mentally. Afraid I would let my teammates down I made the decision to step down for the entire day and spent some time to myself getting in touch with family over video call. As someone who values loyalty it was a tough decision but it was for the best. <br><br>
    Reflecting back on this decision I’m proud of myself for speaking up and being honest with my teammates about not being ok to continue playing. This decision allowed me to reflect and get myself into a better position to continue the tournament after some time to myself.

    <h4>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
    <p><b>Curiosity</b> - I am always eager to try new things and genuinely love learning. This will support me by opening myself to a range of learnings throughout the course. <br><br> 
    <b>Teamwork</b> - Having played sports my whole life, teamwork is something I value highly. I enjoy learning from others as well as helping when I’m able to. <br><br> 
    <b>Determination</b> - When I fail I tend to pick myself back up quickly. Web Development is full of mistakes and I believe my determination will help me get through these busy few months.
    </p>
    <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
    <p>I consider myself a perfectionist at times and this is something that can hold me back in my learning. I don’t like to fail and can often spend too much worrying about completing work to a high standard. Sometimes I need to be reminded that there are bumps in the road to becoming a developer and it’s ok to fail. <br><br> Keeping to myself is something I do often and would like to be encouraged to open up to others.

    <h4>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4>
    <p>Once I was involved in a Customer Support team who were unsatisfied with their pay and decided to call a meeting with the CEO to discuss. I was a senior lead in this team and my Manager had gone on leave so was unaware of the situation. There was tension between myself and some of my team members as I did not believe this was the correct way to go about things. <br><br>I did not want to be involved and was afraid to speak up at first. After noting down my thoughts I decided to be honest and let my team know I wasn’t going to be involved. I gave valid and understanding reasons and portrayed that it was my own personal opinion. After speaking up I had other team members approach me personally with similar opinions. I believe my honesty was effective as it encouraged others to also give their opinion on the situation, noting that this event was run by one particular team member. <br><br>Looking back I’m happy about the decision but as a Senior lead I should have spoken to each team member about their thoughts instead of waiting for them to approach me. As some people can be afraid to speak up, it's important to teach others that their opinions and thoughts are their own and honesty is the best way to communicate.
