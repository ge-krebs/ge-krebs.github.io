    <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
    <p>Emotional Intelligence is about understanding and managing your own emotions and also recognising emotions in others around you. Some examples of this are:
    </p>

      <li>Self confidence and self acceptance</li>
      <li>Empathy towards others</li>
      <li>Effective communication </li>
      <li>Awareness of strengths and limitations</li>
      <li>Acceptance of mistakes</li>
      <li>Management of emotions in difficult/stressful situations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is an essential skill for social situations and helps with collaboration, self-awareness, communication and more. </p>
    <h4>How is EQ different to IQ?</h4>
    <p>IQ is a measure of a person's ability to learn and process information. In the workplace someone with a higher IQ may be able to solve challenging tasks with ease. A person who has a high EQ may be better at facilitating the challenge through teamwork, collaboration and leadership. EQ involves a different set of skills than IQ and is more relevant for relationships and social situations. Whilst IQ is relevant for analytical thinking and problem solving. <br><br> Emotional Intelligence can be improved easier than IQ through practices like mindfulness, active listening and journaling techniques.  </p>
    <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
    <p>EQ is very important for success in personal and professional life. EQ helps to build a range of skills to improve use and management of emotions. It is especially important for dealing with stressful and challenging situations. <br><br> Without the use of EQ in day to day life it may become more difficult to navigate challenges and achieve greater success.</p>
