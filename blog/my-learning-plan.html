    <h4>6 April 2023</h4>
    <h4>My long term goals</h4>
    <p>My long term goal is to contract myself out in the Web Dev world as it’s always been a dream of mine to work for myself. I’m particularly interested in the cryptocurrency industry which is what I work in now. After completing Dev Academy I would like to open my learning up to this industry and give it a try.</p>
    <h4>Learning strengths and limitations</h4>
    <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Researching</li>
      <li>Visual learning</li>
      <li>Hands on</li>
      <li>Curiosity</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attention</li>
      <p>Regular breaks are needed for me to keep my attention alive</p>
      <li>Listening</li>
      <p>Listening for long periods of time is hard for me</p>
      <li>Commute</li>
      <p>Using public transport my commute to the Wellington campus will be 60mins each way. I do worry this will take up a chunk of my learning time</p>
    </ul>
    <h4>Core skills to develop</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Public speaking or speaking in front of a group</li>
      <li>Ability to teach or describe my learnings and ideas</li>
      <p>I often struggle to turn thoughts into words, the information is there I just have a hard time expressing it verbally or in writing</p>
      <li>Confidence in expressing ideas</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Workload commitments</h4>
    <p>Keeping my physical and mental health to a high standard is the most important thing for me when it comes to managing workloads. Here are some ways I'll stay on top of this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking regular breaks (pomodoro timer + two longer breaks each day)</li>
      <li>Morning exercice</li>
      <li>Time off screens</li>
      <li>Spending time outdoors</li>
      <li>Keeping a healthy diet</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My time in class will be predominately for learning as I'm commited to getting the most out of this bootcamp. I want to help my peers around me as we're all in the same situation and need eachother to lean on. <br><br> When things get tough I'll remind myself of the above and talk to facilitors if needed. Bottling thoughts up is not an option during this time and I'm commited to asking for help in times of stress. Over the weekends I'll take some time out of the house with friends and family to clear my head. I have the support of my friends and family who will help me through this time.</p>
    <h4>How I will seek help</h4>
    <p>Before asking for help I’ll always do my best to fix or answer the problem I have myself as I learn better this way. Having been a remote worker and student previously I am not afraid to ask for help but can waste time on issues that could be resolved quicker by the help of someone else. I will ask for help where I see fit during my studies, whether that is amongst my peers or facilitators. 
    </p>
    <h4>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
    <p>A fun learning environment where we can enjoy our time in class. Flexible learning environments where lectures and teachings are recorded incase of sickness etc. <br><br> I expect for the facilitators to explain their reasoning when helping to fix coding issues. I’d prefer for answers not to be given directly as that doesn’t help me
