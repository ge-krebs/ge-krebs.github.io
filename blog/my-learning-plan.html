      <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
      <h4>27/4/2023</h4>
      <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
      <p>Ultimately my goal is to work for myself, contracting myself out for projects or building my own websites, products, apps etc. Before this goal can be achieved I want to take on roles in either junior tech companies or game development, anything exciting where I can be involved in the creation process. There is a chance I may be able to work as a developer for my current employer, although not confirmed I would like to stay there working there if possible. </p>
      <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
      <p>My biggest strength for bootcamp will be curiosity. I am eager to learn new things and thoroughly enjoy deep diving into learnings. I have always worked well in a team and portray a friendly and easy going personality to others. Based on this Teamwork is a strength that will help me to participate and succeed in group projects.</p>
      <p>My limitations involve attention and listening. Often if listening for longer periods of time I notice my mind shifts and I stop taking in information that is being given. To concur this it will be useful for me to watch the recorded lectures in a faster speed to catch up on any points I missed.</p>
      <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
      <p>Finding my feet and rhythm for the beginning of the bootcamp will be challenging for me. It has been a while since I've had some form of morning routine and spending every day of the week studying is something I haven't done before. </p>
      <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      <p>Understanding how to have tough conversations and speak my voice in tense situations. Also being able to talk in-front of a group, I feel as if I'm good at expressing ideas within small groups but can sometimes shy away when it comes to larger groups.</p>
      <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
      <p>One thing I didn't like last time I was in a classroom is how teachers would often shift all focus to students who were behind or took longer to learn. Because I wasn't one of those students, this meant I made my way through school passing everything I needed but not being challenged to achieve better results. I expect the team to involve themselves with all students no matter their abilities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fun learning environment</li>
        <li>Help and reassurance in times of stress</li>
        <li>Assistance when stuck or behind in work</li>
        <li>Motivating students to achieve the best they can</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Hold myself accountable to routine as specified in my foundations learning plan</li>
        <li>Taking time away from the computer in times of stress</li>
        <li>Understanding when I may be stressed and asking for help or making a plan to overcome it</li>
        <li>Spend time outdoors and away from my working space</li>
        <li>Expect that parts of this course will be tough and learn how to overcome them without frustration</li>
        <li>Take each day as it comes and focus on the present moment</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
    <h4>6 April 2023</h4>
    <h4>My long term goals</h4>
    <p>My long term goal is to contract myself out in the Web Dev world as it’s always been a dream of mine to work for myself. I’m particularly interested in the cryptocurrency industry which is what I work in now. After completing Dev Academy I would like to open my learning up to this industry and give it a try.</p>
    <h4>Learning strengths and limitations</h4>
    <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Researching</li>
      <li>Visual learning</li>
      <li>Hands on</li>
      <li>Curiosity</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attention</li>
      <p>Regular breaks are needed for me to keep my attention alive</p>
      <li>Listening</li>
      <p>Listening for long periods of time is hard for me</p>
      <li>Commute</li>
      <p>Using public transport my commute to the Wellington campus will be 60mins each way. I do worry this will take up a chunk of my learning time</p>
    </ul>
    <h4>Core skills to develop</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Public speaking or speaking in front of a group</li>
      <li>Ability to teach or describe my learnings and ideas</li>
      <p>I often struggle to turn thoughts into words, the information is there I just have a hard time expressing it verbally or in writing</p>
      <li>Confidence in expressing ideas</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Workload commitments</h4>
    <p>Keeping my physical and mental health to a high standard is the most important thing for me when it comes to managing workloads. Here are some ways I'll stay on top of this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking regular breaks (pomodoro timer + two longer breaks each day)</li>
      <li>Morning exercice</li>
      <li>Time off screens</li>
      <li>Spending time outdoors</li>
      <li>Keeping a healthy diet</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My time in class will be predominately for learning as I'm commited to getting the most out of this bootcamp. I want to help my peers around me as we're all in the same situation and need eachother to lean on. <br><br> When things get tough I'll remind myself of the above and talk to facilitors if needed. Bottling thoughts up is not an option during this time and I'm commited to asking for help in times of stress. Over the weekends I'll take some time out of the house with friends and family to clear my head. I have the support of my friends and family who will help me through this time.</p>
    <h4>How I will seek help</h4>
    <p>Before asking for help I’ll always do my best to fix or answer the problem I have myself as I learn better this way. Having been a remote worker and student previously I am not afraid to ask for help but can waste time on issues that could be resolved quicker by the help of someone else. I will ask for help where I see fit during my studies, whether that is amongst my peers or facilitators. 
    </p>
    <h4>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
    <p>A fun learning environment where we can enjoy our time in class. Flexible learning environments where lectures and teachings are recorded incase of sickness etc. <br><br> I expect for the facilitators to explain their reasoning when helping to fix coding issues. I’d prefer for answers not to be given directly as that doesn’t help me
