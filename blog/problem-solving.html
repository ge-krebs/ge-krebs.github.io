      <h4>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h4>
      <p>The superfizzbuzz challenge was the most difficult in the JavaScript Kata for me. The problem involved using the standard fizzbuzz function to print the results (1,2,fizz etc) but have them pushed into a new array. I wanted to try my best at resolving this without asking for help as I thought I was capable. Frustration was what I felt after I had spent a few hours trying to resolve the challenge. At this point I found myself writing random lines of code and just hoping something would stick. After almost using up the timebox (and also attempting this challenge on two different days) I jumped into Discord to find any threads related to superfizzbuzz. I ended up watching the video Joseph posted about the challenge, after watching this it was clear on what I needed to do. Although I didn’t fully resolve this myself I learnt that there is a time that asking or looking for help is much more beneficial than spending hours on a question. </p>
      <h4>A problem I solved with elegance</h4>
      <p>During the JS Olympics challenge I challenged myself to resolve some of the questions with minimal use of Google. Question 3 asked to remove odd numbers using a function that took an array of numbers as a parameter. I first used Pseudocode to break the question down into what was needing to be resolved. Along with these notes I also made a note of how the function would be called with an array of numbers, this helps me to understand what sort of code is being pushed into the function. I knew the function needed to return a new array of odd numbers at the end so I started by creating an empty array. After this I was easily able to solve the question by using a for loop and if statement to find the odd numbers and push them into my newly created array. I was proud of myself for resolving this challenge without much use of Google and the only part I really got stuck on was the mathematics to calculate an odd number. I was really proud of writing my own code and was surprised at how easy it was to resolve when I took the time to understand the question and build a plan to answer it!</p>

      <h4>A time when I was reluctant to ask for help</h4>
      <p>Although I have used the dots challenge as a point of talking for a few questions before I think this example shows a time where I was reluctant to ask for help. Because I was stuck here for a few days I had assumed that everyone else had resolved the question and thought I was the only one still stuck on this challenge. I was reluctant to ask for help because of this thinking and also because there had been threads about this challenge in the days prior. I thought because there had already been some hints given in Discord I should have been able to resolve this by now. Another thing that made me reluctant to ask was that I knew I had misunderstood the task to begin with. I’d gone on a tangent of writing a bunch of code that was in the complete wrong direction of the right answer, something I did not want to share with my peers. </p>
