      <h4>26/04/2023</h4>
      <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>How to improve my confidence and how to get the best out of me</li>
        <li>The importance of knowing my identity, strengths and limitations and why knowing these is important for my learning</li>
        <li>Eliminating negative thoughts towards my abilities</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
        <p>Empathy</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Empathy means being considerate of others thoughts and towards peers, yourself and even clients. In programming and learning it's important to understand others around you before acting or speaking up. Having empathy for others will help with building strong relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Awareness</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowing who you are is important for any situation, being aware of yourself can help with belief. It also helps to understand how we might go about solving problems or how we view learnings. </li>
        </ul>
       <p>Values</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understanding personal values can help to determine learning styles, strengths and limitations. Values can also hold you accountable to learnings and motivate you to push further and achieve greater results.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
      <p>Neuroplasticity surprised me the most and it was a subject I had never touched on previously. Understanding how it works and recognising that the brain can change at any age really motivated me. It has been a bad habit of mine to think of myself as a slow learner in past, learning about this and other things during Core has helped me to eliminate those thoughts.</p>
      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
      <p>I wouldn't say the core learnings were challenging but I did find the writing and reflection tough. Turning thoughts into words is challenging and even more when you're writing your own opinions rather than facts.</p>
    <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h4>
    <p>It's almost more important in a certain way. Learning the core components overall helps with the tech learning. All of the components taught get you thinking about what you can do to get the most of yourself, how you learn, to not compare yourself to others and most importantly confidence in yourself. </p>
    <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
    <p>No I haven't felt that way. The Core learning has been a great break from tech and it's also given me more confidence in myself for learning the tech components. The core exercises have really implied the importance of looking after yourself and how I can get the best out of myself for this course.</p>
